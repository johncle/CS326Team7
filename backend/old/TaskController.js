// The controller pattern is a design pattern commonly used in software
// engineering to separate the business logic of an application from its
// presentation layer. It organizes the code in a way that keeps the
// handling of user requests, business rules, and data processing separate
// from the user interface and data models. This pattern is especially
// useful in applications that involve handling HTTP requests, such as
// web applications, where different types of requests need distinct
// processing workflows.

// In the controller pattern, a "controller" is responsible for taking user
// input (e.g., an HTTP request), processing it according to the business
// logic, and sending a response. By using this pattern, each controller
// method manages a specific functionality, like adding a task or updating
// a user profile, which keeps the logic modular and reusable. Controllers
// interact with models (for data) and views (for user feedback) without
// knowing the internal details of each, promoting low coupling.

// The controller pattern also improves maintainability by isolating
// different concerns in the codebase. Changes to business logic or data
// processing can be made within the controller without affecting other
// parts of the application. Additionally, this pattern allows for easier
// testing, as each controller can be tested in isolation to verify that it
// handles input and output correctly, without dependencies on the
// application's interface or data storage layers.
