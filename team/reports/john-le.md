### November 14, 2024

- **Task**: Started refactoring app into single page app by creating components and views. Also setup devtools
- **Details**: Saw on Piazza that course staff were expecting a single page app, so I started work on refactoring the initial multi-page structure into a SPA using components, which is completed in the "got navbar functioning and integrated it into app controller, but pages are not implemented yet" commit. The components are AppController, HomePage, Navbar, and EventHub. I also set up developer tools such as prettier for formatting, husky and lint-staged for git precommit hooks, and bootstrap for css.
