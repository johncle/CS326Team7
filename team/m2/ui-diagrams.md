### Description of `ui-diagrams.md` File

The `ui-diagrams.md` file is where your team will visually and descriptively explain how your web application will look and function from the user’s perspective. This document is essential for planning the user interface (UI) and ensuring that your application’s design is aligned with your users' needs.

Your description should include:

1. **UI Diagrams**: Include diagrams or sketches of the key screens or interfaces of your application. These diagrams should show the layout, key elements, and user interactions on each screen. You can use wireframes, mockups, or hand-drawn sketches, as long as they are clear and demonstrate the major components of your UI.

2. **Explanation of Each Diagram**: Along with each diagram, provide a brief description of what the user will see and do on that screen. Explain how the user will interact with the application, what actions they can take, and how each screen connects to the overall user experience.

3. **Use Cases**: For each diagram, describe the specific user scenarios or "use cases" that demonstrate how users will interact with the application. For example, explain how a user might navigate from one screen to another, complete a task, or achieve a goal within the application.

This file should give a clear picture of how users will engage with your web application and provide insight into the layout and design decisions your team is making. It will help you align your design with your target users and ensure that your UI supports the problem-solving goals of your application. You should have no more than 3-4 at this stage. We are looking for you to give us the general idea, not all possible UI components, features, and configurations.

Please see the [example file](https://github.com/umass-cs-326/ms02-example/blob/main/team/m2/ui-diagrams.md?plain=1) and format yours accordingly.
