## Tag-Based Search (Filter In/Out)

Users will be able to search for songs by filtering in or out specific tags. For example, a user might search for “upbeat jazz” or exclude “sad” songs from their results. This gives users granular control over the types of songs they want to discover or avoid.
Tag-based search allows users to fine-tune their discovery experience, making it easier to find songs that match specific criteria while filtering out unwanted tags.

The AI DJ can suggest songs based on the user’s current emotional state and previous preferences. This feature simplifies the playlist creation process by automatically selecting songs based on user moods or events, saving time and enhancing the user’s listening experience.
