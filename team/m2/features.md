### Description of `features.md` File

The `features.md` file is where your team will outline the key functionalities of your web application. This document should describe the major features that will make your application useful, functional, and relevant to your target users. It is important to not only list the features but to briefly explain their purpose and how they contribute to solving the problem you identified in the `problem.md` file.

Your description should include:

1. **Feature Name**: Provide a clear, concise name for each feature.

2. **Feature Description**: Explain what the feature does and how users will interact with it. Describe the value this feature adds to the user experience and how it addresses part of the problem your application is solving.

3. **Assigned Team Member**: Next to each feature, list the team member responsible for overseeing its development. This helps distribute responsibilities and ensures that every feature has clear ownership.

Each feature should directly contribute to solving the problem your application is addressing. Your list should be high-level, but with enough detail to give a sense of how each feature will work. You should expect that they will eventually break down into more fine-grained features when you start thinking about each feature aspect in more detail. Be realistic about what you can accomplish in the given timeframe, focusing on the most impactful features for your application. These high-level features should impact every level of the stack. This file will serve as a starting guide for your team as you begin building the application.

Please see the [example file](https://github.com/umass-cs-326/ms02-example/blob/main/team/m2/features.md?plain=1) and format yours accordingly.
