# Problem Statement

## Problem Description

Music is something that is universally enjoyed, but sometimes listening to the same songs repeatedly can get boring. When people want to discover new music, finding songs they actually like isn't always easy. They may not know where to look, or when they do, they might be unhappy with the recommendations they get. With so much music out there, finding new tracks that fit their tastes can feel frustrating and time-consuming.

## Proposed Solution

Our web application, **Sonar**, aims to provide an engaging way for users to discover new music that aligns with their tastes and preferences. By utilizing recommendation algorithms and personalized features, Sonar simplifies the process of finding enjoyable songs while fostering communities where users can share their experiences with others.

Key features include:

- **Music Discovery**: Sonar's personalized recommendation algorithm curates songs tailored to a user's favorite genres, listening habits, and song preferences.
- **Mood and Event Playlists**: Users can generate playlists for specific moods or events such as chill, study, or rage.
- **Tag Search**: Users can search for songs based on specific tags such as genre, mood, tempo, instrumentation, etc.
- **Communities**: Users can add friends, join communities, and share songs within these groups.

By combining personalized recommendations, curated playlists, and social sharing features, Sonar will enhance the way users discover and engage with music, making music discovery more enjoyable and community-driven.

## Why This Matters

Music is not only a key source of personal enjoyment, but also an important way people connect with others. Whether it's bonding over shared tastes or discovering new artists together, music plays a big role in social interactions. However, finding new bangers can often be a slow and frustrating process, especially when existing playlists might not provide users with what they want. By allowing users to filter music based on tags, discovering and sharing new songs becomes easier and more enjoyable, helping people connect with others through shared playlists and recommendations.
