### Description of `problem.md` File

The `problem.md` file is where your team will describe the core issue your web application aims to solve and how your application addresses it. This document is crucial for laying the foundation of your project, as it clearly defines the problem, explains why it matters, and introduces your proposed solution.

Your description should include:

1. **Problem Description**: Clearly state the problem your target users face. Why is this a relevant or important issue? Describe the real-world impact of the problem and the pain points your users experience.

2. **Proposed Solution**: Detail how your web application will address the problem. What features or functionalities will your application include to help solve the issue? The solution should be directly tied to the problem, demonstrating a clear benefit to the users.

3. **Why This Matters**: Explain the importance of solving this problem. How will solving this issue improve the lives or experiences of your target users? This section helps justify the need for your application and sets the stage for its development.

This markdown file should be short, concise, but thorough, providing enough detail to clearly communicate your projectâ€™s purpose. Your problem statement is key to ensuring that your entire project stays focused and aligned with the identified need.
