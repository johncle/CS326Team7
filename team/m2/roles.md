[terrible commit: restructured entire app to be single page app based on class examples (unfinished, broken), outlined basic components and pages in src/components/, setup bootstrap for ui components, setup prettier and corresponding precommit hooks for standardized formatting](https://github.com/johncle/CS326Team7/commit/44ffa082f8a4875bd6112469c0568f1bbe88305f): Saw on Piazza that course staff were expecting a single page app, so I started work on refactoring the initial multi-page structure into a SPA using components, which is completed in the "got navbar functioning and integrated it into app controller, but pages are not implemented yet" commit. I also set up developer tools such as prettier for formatting, husky and lint-staged for git precommit hooks, and bootstrap for css.
