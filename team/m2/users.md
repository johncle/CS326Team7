### Description of `users.md` File

The `users.md` file is where your team will define the target audience for your web application. Understanding who your users are is critical to building an application that meets their needs and solves their problems. This document should provide a clear picture of your intended users and explain why your application will be valuable to them.

Your description should include:

1. **Primary Audience**: Identify the key groups of people who will benefit from using your application. Consider characteristics like age, occupation, experience, or any specific needs that define your audience. Be as specific as possible, but ensure that these user groups align with the problem your application addresses.

2. **User Needs**: For each identified user group, explain their specific needs or challenges that your application will help solve. This section should tie back to the problem you described in the `problem.md` file, demonstrating how your application provides value to these users.

3. **Why These Users Matter**: Provide a brief justification for why these users are important to the success of your project. Explain why solving this problem for these specific groups will have an impact, either personally or professionally.

Your `users.md` file should give your team a clear understanding of who you are designing for, ensuring that your project stays focused on meeting the needs of your target users. Keep the descriptions concise but detailed enough to guide your design and development decisions.
