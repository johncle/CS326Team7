# COMPSCI 326 Web Programming

Version: 10-07-2024

## Project Milestone #2 Web Application Concept and Design

In this milestone, your team will collaboratively brainstorm and submit a project proposal in **markdown format**. This submission will be organized within your team’s GitHub repository and will be used to set the foundation for your web application project.

## Instructions

The following is an overview of what you need to do for this milestone. Each step includes a brief description. However, the rest of the document provides additional details and formatting instructions that you must review before taking action of these steps. It is in your best interest to read the entire document completely before starting otherwise you may need to revert and redo work which wastes time, energy, and creativity.

### 1. Brainstorm and Refine Ideas

   - Work as a team to brainstorm multiple ideas for your web application. Narrow these ideas down to a feasible and impactful project that aligns with the course requirements. Your application must solve a clear problem and offer meaningful features for your target users. Remember, this must be a **web application** and not simply a website. You may include social media features, but creating a full social media application is not allowed.

### 2. Create a GitHub Repository

   - One team member should create a **GitHub repository** for your project and add all team members. This repository will serve as the hub for your project’s code and documentation.
   - Inside the repository, create a folder named `team/m2` where you will submit the markdown files that outline your proposal for this milestone.

### 3. Markdown File Submission

   Your submission must include the following markdown files, each addressing specific aspects of your project:

   - `problem.md`: A markdown file describing the problem your application will solve and the proposed solution.
   - `features.md`: A detailed list of the key features your application will have, with team members assigned to each feature.
   - `users.md`: A markdown file that explains your target users and their specific needs.
   - `ui-diagrams.md`: Diagrams and explanations of the UI, including how users will interact with the interface.
   - `data.md`: A file that describes the types of data your application will handle, but without specifying storage methods.
   - `roles.md`: A markdown file detailing each team member's role and their top 3 commits for this milestone submission, with links to those commits in GitHub and short descriptions of their contributions.

### 4. Team Roles and Commit Responsibilities
   
   Your team should assign specific management roles to each team member. As mentioned, each member must list their **top 3 commits** in the `roles.md` file, with links to the commits and a brief description of what was completed in each commit. These roles are **not technical responsibilities** (e.g., frontend or backend) but organizational roles such as meeting coordination, task management, and communication.

### 5. Team Member Reports

   As part of this milestone and all future milestones, your team is required to set up a directory called `team/reports` in your GitHub repository. This directory will include a markdown file for each team member where they will document their contributions to the project over time.

## Markdown Files and Content

Each markdown file should follow a structured format for consistency and clarity. Below are the descriptions of each file. To see an example repository and how you are to format each file for you submission, please see the example repository:

[https://github.com/umass-cs-326/ms02-example](https://github.com/umass-cs-326/ms02-example)

### Description of `problem.md` File

The `problem.md` file is where your team will describe the core issue your web application aims to solve and how your application addresses it. This document is crucial for laying the foundation of your project, as it clearly defines the problem, explains why it matters, and introduces your proposed solution.

Your description should include:

1. **Problem Description**: Clearly state the problem your target users face. Why is this a relevant or important issue? Describe the real-world impact of the problem and the pain points your users experience.

2. **Proposed Solution**: Detail how your web application will address the problem. What features or functionalities will your application include to help solve the issue? The solution should be directly tied to the problem, demonstrating a clear benefit to the users.

3. **Why This Matters**: Explain the importance of solving this problem. How will solving this issue improve the lives or experiences of your target users? This section helps justify the need for your application and sets the stage for its development.

This markdown file should be short, concise, but thorough, providing enough detail to clearly communicate your project’s purpose. Your problem statement is key to ensuring that your entire project stays focused and aligned with the identified need.

Please see the [example file](https://github.com/umass-cs-326/ms02-example/blob/main/team/m2/problem.md?plain=1) and format yours accordingly.

### Description of `features.md` File

The `features.md` file is where your team will outline the key functionalities of your web application. This document should describe the major features that will make your application useful, functional, and relevant to your target users. It is important to not only list the features but to briefly explain their purpose and how they contribute to solving the problem you identified in the `problem.md` file.

Your description should include:

1. **Feature Name**: Provide a clear, concise name for each feature.

2. **Feature Description**: Explain what the feature does and how users will interact with it. Describe the value this feature adds to the user experience and how it addresses part of the problem your application is solving.

3. **Assigned Team Member**: Next to each feature, list the team member responsible for overseeing its development. This helps distribute responsibilities and ensures that every feature has clear ownership.

Each feature should directly contribute to solving the problem your application is addressing. Your list should be high-level, but with enough detail to give a sense of how each feature will work. You should expect that they will eventually break down into more fine-grained features when you start thinking about each feature aspect in more detail. Be realistic about what you can accomplish in the given timeframe, focusing on the most impactful features for your application. These high-level features should impact every level of the stack. This file will serve as a starting guide for your team as you begin building the application.

Please see the [example file](https://github.com/umass-cs-326/ms02-example/blob/main/team/m2/features.md?plain=1) and format yours accordingly.

### Description of `users.md` File

The `users.md` file is where your team will define the target audience for your web application. Understanding who your users are is critical to building an application that meets their needs and solves their problems. This document should provide a clear picture of your intended users and explain why your application will be valuable to them.

Your description should include:

1. **Primary Audience**: Identify the key groups of people who will benefit from using your application. Consider characteristics like age, occupation, experience, or any specific needs that define your audience. Be as specific as possible, but ensure that these user groups align with the problem your application addresses.

2. **User Needs**: For each identified user group, explain their specific needs or challenges that your application will help solve. This section should tie back to the problem you described in the `problem.md` file, demonstrating how your application provides value to these users.

3. **Why These Users Matter**: Provide a brief justification for why these users are important to the success of your project. Explain why solving this problem for these specific groups will have an impact, either personally or professionally.

Your `users.md` file should give your team a clear understanding of who you are designing for, ensuring that your project stays focused on meeting the needs of your target users. Keep the descriptions concise but detailed enough to guide your design and development decisions.

Please see the [example file](https://github.com/umass-cs-326/ms02-example/blob/main/team/m2/users.md?plain=1) and format yours accordingly.

### Description of `ui-diagrams.md` File

The `ui-diagrams.md` file is where your team will visually and descriptively explain how your web application will look and function from the user’s perspective. This document is essential for planning the user interface (UI) and ensuring that your application’s design is aligned with your users' needs.

Your description should include:

1. **UI Diagrams**: Include diagrams or sketches of the key screens or interfaces of your application. These diagrams should show the layout, key elements, and user interactions on each screen. You can use wireframes, mockups, or hand-drawn sketches, as long as they are clear and demonstrate the major components of your UI.

2. **Explanation of Each Diagram**: Along with each diagram, provide a brief description of what the user will see and do on that screen. Explain how the user will interact with the application, what actions they can take, and how each screen connects to the overall user experience.

3. **Use Cases**: For each diagram, describe the specific user scenarios or "use cases" that demonstrate how users will interact with the application. For example, explain how a user might navigate from one screen to another, complete a task, or achieve a goal within the application.

This file should give a clear picture of how users will engage with your web application and provide insight into the layout and design decisions your team is making. It will help you align your design with your target users and ensure that your UI supports the problem-solving goals of your application. You should have no more than 3-4 at this stage. We are looking for you to give us the general idea, not all possible UI components, features, and configurations.

Please see the [example file](https://github.com/umass-cs-326/ms02-example/blob/main/team/m2/ui-diagrams.md?plain=1) and format yours accordingly.

### Description of `data.md` File

The `data.md` file is where your team will describe the types of data your web application will handle. This document should provide a high-level overview of the data that is critical to your application's functionality, including any user data, input data, or system-generated data. The focus should be on describing what data your application will use and how it will be structured, but you do not need to describe the specific storage methods or databases at this stage.

Your description should include:

1. **Data Types**: List and describe each type of data that your application will use. For example, user profiles, expenses, transactions, or settings. For each data type, explain what kind of information is captured.
   
2. **Attributes**: For each data type, list the key attributes or fields that will be stored. For example, for a "User Profile" data type, relevant attributes might include name, email, and user preferences. Include any relevant metadata, such as timestamps or IDs.

3. **Relationships Between Data**: If applicable, explain how different types of data are related to each other. For example, a user profile might be related to multiple expense entries, or a savings goal might be related to a user’s transactions. This will help in understanding how your application organizes and uses data.

4. **Data Sources**: Describe where the data comes from. Is it user-input data, data from third-party APIs, or system-generated data? This is important for understanding the flow of data into your application.

This file serves as a foundational guide to your application’s data, ensuring that your team understands what information will be handled and how it is organized. Although you don’t need to discuss specific storage methods at this point, this document will help guide decisions related to data management as the project progresses.

Please see the [example file](https://github.com/umass-cs-326/ms02-example/blob/main/team/m2/data.md?plain=1) and format yours accordingly.

### Description of `roles.md` File

The `roles.md` file is where your team will outline the non-technical roles and responsibilities of each team member. Every team member should be assigned a unique role that focuses on a specific task related to the overall management and organization of the project. These roles are critical for ensuring that the team functions effectively and efficiently throughout the course of the project.

Each role should be designed to:

1. **Support Team Organization**: Ensure that the team stays on schedule, communicates effectively, and manages its tasks and meetings well.
2. **Assign Clear Responsibilities**: Each role should focus on a specific aspect of managing the team, such as coordinating meetings, tracking tasks, or ensuring that deadlines are met. These roles are not technical (i.e., not related to front-end or back-end development) but are focused on project management and team collaboration.
3. **Unique for Each Team Member**: Every team member must have a distinct role, ensuring that each individual has clear responsibilities that do not overlap with others.

For each role, you should include:

1. **Role Name**: Clearly define the role (e.g., Project Manager, Timekeeper, Note-Taker).
2. **Role Description**: Briefly describe the key responsibilities of the role and how it helps the team stay organized.
3. **Assigned Team Member**: State which team member is responsible for this role.
4. **Top 3 Commits**: List the top 3 commits made by each member in this milestone and link to them in the GitHub repository. Include a short description of what was completed in each commit. These commits should demonstrate the member’s contributions to the project, particularly related to their role.

The `roles.md` file will help ensure accountability and make sure that each team member contributes to the project’s organization and overall success. This document will evolve as the project progresses, with each member’s contributions being clearly tracked.

Please see the [example file](https://github.com/umass-cs-326/ms02-example/blob/main/team/m2/roles.md?plain=1) and format yours accordingly.

## Team Member Reports

As part of this milestone and all future milestones, your team is required to set up a directory called `team/reports` in your GitHub repository. This directory will include a markdown file for each team member where they will document their contributions to the project over time.

Instructions:

1. Directory Setup:
   - In the root of your repository, create a folder named reports.
   - Each team member should create their own markdown file inside this directory. The file name must follow the format `FIRST-LAST.md`, where `FIRST` is the member’s first name and `LAST` is their last name. For example, if your name is Alice Johnson, your file will be named `alice-johnson.md`. **Please follow this format exactly**.
   
2. Purpose:
   - The `team/reports` folder is designed to track each team member’s contributions to the project as it progresses.
   - Every time a team member completes a task, makes a significant commit, or contributes to any aspect of the project, they should log the details of that contribution in their markdown file.

3. Contribution Logging:
   - Each contribution should be timestamped and should include a brief description of the work that was completed. You should also link to any relevant GitHub commits or documents, if applicable.
   - Example entries might include:
	 * Setting up a project repository.
	 * Writing sections of documentation.
	 * Implementing features or fixing bugs.
	 * Managing communication or organizing tasks.

4. Review Process:
   - The `team/reports` folder will be used to assess individual contributions to the project during each milestone. Keeping it up to date is essential for showing your active participation.
   - Make sure to log each significant task you complete to ensure that your work is recognized.

The reports folder is designed to track each team member’s contributions to the project as it progresses. Every time a team member completes a task, makes a significant commit, or contributes to any aspect of the project, they should log the details of that contribution in their markdown file.

Please see the [example file](https://github.com/umass-cs-326/ms02-example/blob/main/team/reports/alice-johnson.md?plain=1) and format yours accordingly. See the rest of the reports by visiting the [reports folder](https://github.com/umass-cs-326/ms02-example/blob/main/team/reports)

## Submission

Please submit a single file to Gradescope called `github.md` that contains **only** the URL of your newly created repository. This is **not** an auto-graded assignment. It will be reviewed manually by the teaching team.

## Grading Rubric

The project proposal will be evaluated based on both **teamwork** (overall quality and organization of the project) and **individual contributions** (each team member's specific work and commits). The total number of points is **100**, with **70% allocated to team contributions** and **30% to individual contributions**. Each team member will receive an individual score for their contributions to the project.
